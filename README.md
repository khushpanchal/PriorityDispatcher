    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // this one
    }
}
```

2. Update your module level build.gradle file with the following dependency.
   
```Groovy

```

### Usage

- Low Level Priority Task

```Kotlin
CoroutineScope(PriorityDispatcher.low()).launch {
    // Task with low priority
}
```
- Medium Level Priority Task

```Kotlin
CoroutineScope(PriorityDispatcher.medium()).launch {
    // Task with medium priority
}
```
- High Level Priority Task

```Kotlin
CoroutineScope(PriorityDispatcher.high()).launch {
    // Task with high priority
}
```
